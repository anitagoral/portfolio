# Welcome to My Portfolio!

>All of the work posted on here are examples of work I have done, either for fun or for school. 
>I have been doing hair for over 10 years and have been developing my skills as a hair designer. Recently I have decided to go back to school to pursue my passion for computer technology. I am looking for a position where I can combine my passion for computers with my past work experience. I love the challenge computer programming gives me. It is my passion to look at a problem and solve that issue via technology. As someone who has been working in the hair industry, I have mastered working with people. and have excellent communication and people skills. I am confident that I can convince you of my qualifications given the opportunity for an interview and I look forward to hearing from you!
